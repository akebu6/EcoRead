# EcoRead
Uncover the hidden insights in climate change-related text data to better understand the impact and take informed actions.

## Our Inspiration 💡  
---
Climate Change is a prevailing topic in today's world, everyone is concerned about it and don't know what information to trust as the internet has now become a vast place where anyone can share their own opinion would take it as gospel truth. For this reason, the team decided to create EcoRead, a place where users can search information about climate change.

The increasing urgency of climate change and its potential consequences have motivated us to undertake this project. We believe that by analyzing text data related to climate change, we can gain valuable insights that can help address the issue more effectively.

# What it Does?

Our project aims to analyze large volumes of text data related to climate change, such as scientific papers, news articles, social media posts, and policy documents. By using natural language processing techniques, we extract key information, identify trends, and uncover patterns in the data. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the causes, effects, and potential solutions to climate change.

Users can interact with our project by inputting their own text data or accessing pre-analyzed datasets. The system will then perform various analyses, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and entity recognition, to extract meaningful information. The benefits of this project include better understanding of climate change, identification of key stakeholders and influencers, and the ability to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions.

## How we Built it 🏠
---
To build this project, we used a combination of programming languages and tools. We utilized Python for data preprocessing, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms. Libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn were used for text analysis tasks. We also employed web scraping techniques to gather data from various sources. The project also utilises Streamlit, an open-source Python library to create the UI for the project.
